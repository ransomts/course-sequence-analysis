## Define some data sets
### Major cip codes {.tabset}

I'll be just using earth science cip codes until we have a list of biology cips. It's /possible/ to use a shiny app to compute stuff interactively but that would require a good deal more work and being hosted off of Tim's home server so it'll be slow to load.

#### Computing

## which cips have the most time in program?

okay so we've decided which cip code set we're looking at! Great!

Lets see some graphs describing our data within that set. Which cips are the most represented?

```

```{r}
